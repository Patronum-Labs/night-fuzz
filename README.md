## 🌙 Nightly Fuzzing

The `.github/workflows/nightFuzz.yml` file configures a GitHub Action to run extensive fuzzing every night at midnight UTC. This allows for much larger test runs without impacting your daily development workflow.

To customize the nightly fuzzing:
1. Open `.github/workflows/nightly-fuzz.yml`
2. Adjust the cron schedule or fuzzing parameters in `foundry.toml` as needed
